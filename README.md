This Project deals with the effect of meditation on human brainwave components such as alhpa, beta and gamma. This work proves that human being gets effected by yoga in a certain way.
we have considered three different yoga techniques such as himalayn, vipashanna and isha sunya, and have proved the effect of each on human brainwave is differnet and order of effect is also different
the dataset used is taken by Meditation research of institute(MRI), Rishikesh, India, which is publically available online. Taking the dataset we have performed feature engineering and data analysis.
In our project, we found that among the three meditation techniques considered, Vipassana is the most effective in enhancing both concentration and relaxation. In comparison, the Himalayan and Isha Surya techniques exhibit similar effects on improving concentration and relaxation. Individuals seeking both physical exercise and mental fitness should opt for Isha Surya, as it incorporates physical activity, whereas those focusing solely on mental fitness should choose the Himalayan technique, which does not involve physical exercise.
